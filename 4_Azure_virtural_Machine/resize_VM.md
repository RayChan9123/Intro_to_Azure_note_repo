# Resizing Azure Virtual Machines

## Resizing for More Power

- **Resource Increase:** You can resize a virtual machine (VM) to enhance its CPU, memory, disk throughput, and networking capabilities.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for tasks that require more resources, such as artificial intelligence workloads.

## Cost Considerations

- **Cost Impact:** Resizing to a larger VM configuration will increase costs.
- **Saving Money:** If additional power is no longer needed, resizing to a smaller VM can reduce costs.

## Process of Resizing

- **Resizing Steps:** The resizing process involves selecting a new VM size in the Azure Portal.
- **Data Migration:** Your data is automatically moved to the new VM configuration.
- **Service Interruption:** The VM will restart during resizing, temporarily stopping any running operations.
