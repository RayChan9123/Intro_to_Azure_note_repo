# Virtual Networks and Network Security in Azure

## Virtual Networks and Subnets

- **Virtual Networks:** Azure enables you to create virtual networks that simulate physical networks.
- **Subnets and IP Address Spaces:** Configure subnets and IP address spaces to align with your on-premises network setup.

## Network Security Groups (NSGs)

- **Traffic Control:** NSGs manage traffic flow within your virtual network by enforcing rules.
- **Port Management:** Control communication by opening specific ports as needed.

## VNet Peering and Integration

- **VNet Peering:** Connect multiple virtual networks using VNet Peering.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate your virtual network with other Azure services, other clouds, or on-premises resources.
