### Remote Access Methods
- **Access Options**: You can access your Azure virtual machine (VM) using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH). Ensure the VM is running and the appropriate TCP ports (3389 for RDP, 22 for SSH) are open.

### Security Considerations
- **Port Management**: It's recommended to change the default ports to enhance security or use Azure Bastion, which allows remote access without opening any ports or installing software.

### Azure Bastion
- **Secure Connection**: This service enables you to connect to your VM directly from the Azure portal using your web browser, providing a secure and convenient method for remote access.
