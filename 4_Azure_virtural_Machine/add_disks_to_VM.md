# Data Disks in Azure Virtual Machines

## Data Disks

- **Adding Disks:** You can add extra data disks to your virtual machine, choosing between standard hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs).
- **Performance vs. Cost:** SSDs offer faster performance but come at a higher cost compared to standard hard drives.

## Disk Configuration

- **Custom Options:** Configure the size, speed, and encryption of the data disks to suit your needs.
- **Creation Methods:** Disks can be created from scratch, snapshots, or blob storage.

## Mounting Disks

- **Windows:** Assign a drive letter to the new data disk.
- **Linux:** Create a mount point to use the disk within your virtual machine.
