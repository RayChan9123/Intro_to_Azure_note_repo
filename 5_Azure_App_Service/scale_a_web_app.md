### Types of Scaling

- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the power of a virtual machine (e.g., more CPU, memory).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the number of virtual machines running the app.

### Elasticity and Agility

- **Elasticity**: The ability to scale in both directions (up/down or in/out) to save costs and meet demand.
- **Agility**: Automating scaling operations based on predefined rules to handle varying loads efficiently.

### Scaling in Azure App Service

- **Vertical Scaling**: Adjusting the hardware configuration of the app service plan.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding or removing instances (VMs) manually or automatically based on metrics like HTTP queue length.
