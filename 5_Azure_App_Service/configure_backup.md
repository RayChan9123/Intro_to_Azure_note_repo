### Importance of Backups

Backups are crucial for recovering your web app if it gets accidentally deleted. They are stored in Azure storage, ensuring durability and reliability.

### Configuration

You can configure backups easily through the Azure portal. Automatic backups can be scheduled, and you can also perform manual backups.

### Backup Options

App Service can back up both your web app and any linked databases. However, backups are not available in all pricing plans, so you need to check your plan's features.
