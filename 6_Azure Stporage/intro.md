### Purpose of Azure Storage

Azure Storage is a scalable and flexible solution for storing data that doesn't require the full features of a database system.

### Types of Storage

The video focuses on Azure Blob Storage, which is used for storing unstructured data like images, documents, and videos.

### Storage Tiers

There are three tiers—Hot, Cool, and Archive—each designed for different access needs and cost management.

### Access Control

Shared Access Signatures (SAS tokens) can be used to grant temporary access to your storage with specific permissions and expiration dates.
